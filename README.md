## 📊 Project Overview

Breast cancer is one of the most common cancers affecting women worldwide.  
Early and accurate detection is critical for successful treatment.  
In this notebook, we explore the dataset, perform feature analysis, and train ML models to classify tumors as **benign** or **malignant**.
